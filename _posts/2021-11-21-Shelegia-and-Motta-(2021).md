The models in Shelegia and Motta (2021) try to rationalize the so-called "Kill-Zone" for startup innovations. If you are interested in this topic have a look into the repository.
As a result the code was even mentioned on [twitter](https://twitter.com/IgorLetina/status/1470103044645953539). Find explanations to the paper and an exemplary jupyter notebook [here](https://manuelbieri.github.io/shelegia_motta_2021/demo.html).
