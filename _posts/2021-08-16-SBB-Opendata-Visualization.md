During the course Opendata we developed a visualization to compare the delay of a SBB - connection to its rolling stock or the weather during the connection.
Find the demo of the visualization under this [link](https://manuelbieri.github.io/SBB-Opendata-Visualization/) (currently under construction and therefore not working).
