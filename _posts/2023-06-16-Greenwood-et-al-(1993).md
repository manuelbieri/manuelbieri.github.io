Households spend approximately a quarter of their day working at home and thereby amounting to 20-50 percent of GNP. Therefore, by incorporating home pro- duction into a standard real business cycle (RBC) model Greenwood et al. (1993) can more accurately reproduce key macroeconomic characteristics, such as volatility, of the U.S. economy between 1947 and 1987.
